I think there might be a word missing from your question! Are you asking "Why do identity politics matter?" or "Why do we have identity?" or perhaps something else?

If you're asking about identity in general - why we develop and maintain a sense of who we are - there are several fascinating reasons:

**Psychological survival**: Our identity helps us navigate the world consistently. It's like having an internal compass that guides our decisions and helps us predict how we'll react in different situations.

**Social connection**: Identity allows us to find our tribes - people who share similar values, experiences, or characteristics. This creates belonging and community.

**Meaning-making**: Having a coherent sense of self helps us create narrative meaning from our experiences. We're essentially the main character in our own life story.

**Efficiency**: Identity acts as a mental shortcut. Instead of re-deciding our values and preferences constantly, we can rely on "this is who I am" to guide us.

But identity is also fluid and multifaceted - we're not just one thing. We might be a parent, a professional, an artist, an introvert, and a dozen other identities simultaneously.
